            <h2><u>India Tour Packages FAQs</u></h2>
<h3>QQ. Can I make changes to my domestic holiday package?</h3>                                      <img src="honeymoon1.jpg"  alt="honeymoon tour" width="400px" style="float:right">
A. Yes, you can make changes to tour packages. Most online travel agents offer a wide range of 
   customisable tour packages where you may choose transport, stay and sightseeing according to 
   your taste and comfort. However, the itinerary of a group tour or a pre-set holiday package 
   cannot be altered. Such itineraries are designed with fixed travel dates, and all services are  
   on a sharing basis.

<h3>QQ. Do I need to book my flight tickets separately?</h3>                                            
A. No, you don’t have to book the flights separately while making a booking of India tour packages. 
   Your flight is a part of the itinerary, and it will be included in the cost of the package.  
   However, some packages featured on the website might not include airfare. The price listing 
   will either read 'airfare/flight optional' or 'airfare/flight inclusive'. With airfare/flight 
   optional packages, <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">you can decide if you want to take a package with or without airfare.     

<h3>QQ. Can I place a tour booking on hold?</h3>
A. Yes, hold a booking with most OTA by making certain advance payment. Based on the nature of the 
   service and the time left for the service, book holiday packages in India by paying a brief amount  <img src="adventure1.jpg"  alt="adventure" width="400px" style="float:right"> 
   through the website and pay the balance amount in the next 24/48 hours.

<h3>QQ. What is the cancellation policy for holiday packages in India?</h3>
A. The cancellation policy may differ depending on the package, the destination of travel and also on 
   the day of cancellation prior to the journey. And, in case of ‘no show’ or if cancelled less than 
   the minimum stipulated deadline, no refund will be offered. For best information, please check with 
   your travel experts/travel advisors or call the customer service helpline number of your travel service  
   provider.

<h3>QQ. How do I know if my booking is confirmed?</h3>
A. For all India tour packages’ bookings made online, you will receive a confirmation message via email. 
   This email will include your booking/reservation number and travel details. You can also check your      <img src="family1.jpg"  alt="family" width="400px" style="float:right">
   booking status online on the website by filling the details of your booking reference number and your
    email id or mobile number.

<h3>QQ. Is everything included in the cost of the tour package?</h3>
A. A domestic tour package usually includes your breakfast, transport, hotels, flights, sightseeing, 
   monument entry, etc. However, if you want to pursue an activity on your own of your choice, which 
   is not included in your travel itinerary, then the cost is on you. In other words, anything which 
   is not mentioned under the ‘Package Inclusions’ in the inclusions of the travel itinerary will incur 
   an additional cost.

<h3>QQ. Will I get a separate invoice for flights, hotels and transport?</h3>
A. You will get one consolidated invoice for your holiday packages in India, which will have information 
   about your flight, accommodation and transport facilities.

<h3>Q. Can I make cash payment for my domestic holiday package, what are the conditions?</h3>
A. Yes, you can make a cash payment on booking tour packages in India with most online travel agents.       <img src="luxury1.jpg"  alt="luxury" width="500px" style="float:right">
   You can contact travel service providers like Yatra and get in touch with their travel sales 
   representative for any queries on the same.

<h3>Q. Does a package include transport services?</h3>
A. Yes, almost all tour packages include transport services. You can check the services included and 
   excluded for a package under the inclusions on your holiday itinerary. Furthermore, you can ask your 
   travel expert to get information on the type of transport you will be provided during your travel. 
   For instance, a group tour on a pilgrimage trip will be provided with the transport facility of a 
   bus, and it will be a part of the itinerary.

<h3>Q. Does the tour packages include hotels with good ratings?</h3>
A. Most OTAs provide and recommend hotels based on their reviews and ratings put on the internet by <img src="wildlife4.jpg"  alt="luxury" width="400px" style="float:right">
   customers and their previous customer experience. However, many companies do not guarantee hotels’ 
   quality of service and their star ratings. Hence, it is strongly recommended that you cross-check    
   your travel aggregator’s website and go through the reviews and photographs of the hotels before 
   booking India tour packages.</span>
